üìî Documentation
=================
Visit
`Read the Docs <https://ml-investment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
to know more about Ml_investment library.

üõ† Installation
===============


**PyPI version**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ml-investment


**Latest version from source**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/fartuk/ml_investment


**Configuration**

You may use config file `~/.ml_investment/config.json`
to change repo parameters i.e. downloading datasets pathes, models pathes etc.

Private information (i.e. api tokens for private datasets downloading)
should be located at `~/.ml_investment/secrets.json`

‚è≥ Quick Start
==============


Use application model
---------------------



There are several pre-defined fitted models at
``ml_investment.applications``.
It incapsulating data and weights downloading, pipeline creation
and model fitting. So you can just use it without knowing internal structure.

.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.applications.fair_marketcap_yahoo import FairMarketcapYahoo

    fair_marketcap_yahoo = FairMarketcapYahoo()
    fair_marketcap_yahoo.execute(['AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT'])


+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| ticker      | date                    | fair_marketcap_yahoo   |
+=============+=========================+========================+
| AAPL        | 2020-12-31              | 5.173328e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| FB          | 2020-12-31              | 8.442045e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| MSFT        | 2020-12-31              | 4.501329e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+



Create your own pipeline
-------------------------


**1. Download data**

You may download default datasets by
``ml_investment.download_scripts``

.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.download_scripts import download_yahoo
    from ml_investment.utils import load_config

    # Config located at ~/.ml_investment/config.json
    config = load_config()

    download_yahoo.main(config['yahoo_data_path'])

>>> 1365it [03:32,  6.42it/s]
>>> 1365it [01:49,  12.51it/s]

**2. Create dict with dataloaders**

You may choose from default
``ml_investment.data_loaders``
or wrote your own. Each dataloader should have ``load(index)`` interface.

.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.data_loaders.yahoo import YahooQuarterlyData, YahooBaseData

    data = {}
    data['quarterly'] = YahooQuarterlyData(config['yahoo_data_path'])
    data['base'] = YahooBaseData(config['yahoo_data_path'])


**3. Define and fit pipeline**

You may specify all steps of pipeline creation.
Base pipeline consist of the folowing steps:

- Create data dict(it was done in previous step)
- Define features. Features is a number of values
  and characteristics that will be calculated for model trainig.
  Default feature calculators are located at
  ``ml_investment.features``
- Define targets. Target is a final goal of the pipeline, it should
  represent some desired useful property.
  Default target calculators are located at
  ``ml_investment.targets``
- Choose model. Model is machine learning algorithm, core of the pipeline.
  It also may incapsulate validation and other stuff.
  You may use wrappers from
  ``ml_investment.models``

.. code-block:: python

    import lightgbm as lgbm
    from ml_investment.utils import load_config, load_tickers
    from ml_investment.features import QuarterlyFeatures, BaseCompanyFeatures,\
                                       FeatureMerger
    from ml_investment.targets import BaseInfoTarget
    from ml_investment.models import LogExpModel, GroupedOOFModel
    from ml_investment.pipelines import Pipeline
    from ml_investment.metrics import median_absolute_relative_error

    fc1 = QuarterlyFeatures(data_key='quarterly',
                            columns=['netIncome',
                                     'cash',
                                     'totalAssets',
                                     'ebit'],
                            quarter_counts=[2, 4, 10],
                            max_back_quarter=1)

    fc2 = BaseCompanyFeatures(data_key='base', cat_columns=['sector'])

    feature = FeatureMerger(fc1, fc2, on='ticker')

    target = BaseInfoTarget(data_key='base', col='enterpriseValue')

    base_model = LogExpModel(lgbm.sklearn.LGBMRegressor())
    model = GroupedOOFModel(base_model=base_model,
                            group_column='ticker',
                            fold_cnt=4)

    pipeline = Pipeline(data=data,
                        feature=feature,
                        target=target,
                        model=model,
                        out_name='my_super_model')

    tickers = load_tickers()['base_us_stocks']
    pipeline.fit(tickers, metric=median_absolute_relative_error)

>>> {'metric_my_super_model': 0.40599471294301914}

**4. Inference your pipeline**

Since ``ml_investment.models.GroupedOOFModel`` was used,
there are no data leakage and you may use pipeline on the same company tickers.

.. code-block:: python

    pipeline.execute(['AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT'])


+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| ticker      | date                    | my_super_model   |
+=============+=========================+==================+
| AAPL        | 2020-12-31              | 8.170051e+11     |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| FB          | 2020-12-31              | 3.898840e+11     |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| MSFT        | 2020-12-31              | 3.540126e+11     |
