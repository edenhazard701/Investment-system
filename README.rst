üìî Documentation
=================
Visit
`Read the Docs <https://ml-investment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
to know more about Ml_investmrnt library.

üõ† Installation
===============


**PyPI version**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ml-investment


**Latest version from source**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/fartuk/ml_investment

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/fartuk/ml_investment
    $ cd ml_investment
    $ pip install .


**Configuration**

You may use config file `~/.ml_investment/config.json`
to change repo parameters i.e. downloading datasets pathes, models pathes etc.

Private information (i.e. api tokens for private datasets downloading)
should be located at `~/.ml_investment/secrets.json`

‚è≥ Quick Start
==============


Use application model
---------------------



There are several pre-defined fitted models at
``ml_investment.applications``.
It incapsulating data and weights downloading, pipeline creation
and model fitting. So you can just use it without knowing internal structure.

.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.applications.fair_marketcap_yahoo import FairMarketcapYahoo

    fair_marketcap_yahoo = FairMarketcapYahoo()
    fair_marketcap_yahoo.predict(['AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT'])


+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| ticker      | date                    | fair_marketcap_yahoo   |
+=============+=========================+========================+
| AAPL        | 2020-12-31              | 5.173328e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| FB          | 2020-12-31              | 8.442045e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| MSFT        | 2020-12-31              | 4.501329e+11           |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------------+



Create your own pipeline
-------------------------


**1. Download data**

You may download default datasets by
``ml_investment.download_scripts``

.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.download_scripts import download_yahoo
    download_yahoo.main()

>>> 1365it [03:32,  6.42it/s]
>>> 1365it [01:49,  12.51it/s]


**2. Define and fit pipeline**

You may specify all steps of pipeline creation.
Base pipeline consist of the folowing steps:

- Define features. Features is a number of values
  and characteristics that will be calculated for model trainig.
  Default feature calculators are located at
  ``ml_investment.features``
- Define targets. Target is a final goal of the pipeline, it should
  represent some desired useful property.
  Default target calculators are located at
  ``ml_investment.targets``
- Choose model. Model is machine learning algorithm, core of the pipeline.
  It also may incapsulate validateion and other stuff.
  You may use wrappers from
  ``ml_investment.models``
- Choose dataset. It should have all needed for features and targets
  data loading methods.
  There some pre-defined datasets at
  ``ml_investment.data``


.. code-block:: python

    from ml_investment.utils import load_config, load_tickers
    from ml_investment.data import YahooData
    from ml_investment.features import QuarterlyFeatures, BaseCompanyFeatures,\
                                       FeatureMerger
    from ml_investment.target import BaseInfoTarget
    from ml_investment.pipeline import BasePipeline

    config = load_config()
    data_loader = YahooData(config['yahoo_data_path'])

    fc1 = QuarterlyFeatures(columns=['quarterlyNetIncome',
                                     'quarterlyFreeCashFlow',
                                     'quarterlyTotalAssets',
                                     'quarterlyNetDebt'],
                            quarter_counts=[2, 4, 10],
                            max_back_quarter=1)

    fc2 = BaseCompanyFeatures(cat_columns=['sector'])

    feature = FeatureMerger(fc1, fc2, on='ticker')

    target = BaseInfoTarget(col='enterpriseValue')

    base_model = LogExpModel(lgbm.sklearn.LGBMRegressor())
    model = GroupedOOFModel(base_model=base_model,
                            group_column='ticker',
                            fold_cnt=4)

    pipeline = BasePipeline(feature=feature,
                            target=target,
                            model=model,
                            metric=median_absolute_relative_error,
                            out_name='my_super_model')

    tickers = load_tickers()['base_us_stocks']
    pipeline.fit(data_loader, tickers)

>>> {'metric_my_super_model': 0.40599471294301914}

**3. Inference your pipeline**

Since ``ml_investment.models.GroupedOOFModel`` was used,
there are no data leakage and you may use pipeline on the same company tickers.

.. code-block:: python

    pipeline.execute(data_loader, ['AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT'])


+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| ticker      | date                    | my_super_model   |
+=============+=========================+==================+
| AAPL        | 2020-12-31              | 8.170051e+11     |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| FB          | 2020-12-31              | 3.898840e+11     |
+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| MSFT        | 2020-12-31              | 3.540126e+11     |
